# Adapta-Desk

This was a project for the baccalaureate exam. With it, we also participated in the National Olympiad of Engineering Sciences and we made it to the nationals.
It is a desk that can be adjusted in height and inclination.
The desk can be controlled by the side buttons or an Android application by bluetooth.

> The application can be found [here](/Application/Adapta_Test.apk).
